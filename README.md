An automated payroll system is a sophisticated tool that streamlines the process of generating employee pay slips by integrating attendance tracking. 
Each day, employee attendance is recorded in the system, capturing crucial data such as hours worked, leave taken, and overtime. 
This information is then seamlessly processed to calculate accurate wages, considering various factors like hourly rates, deductions, and bonuses. 
The system ensures timely and precise payroll management, minimizing human error and administrative workload. Employees receive their pay slips promptly, reflecting a transparent breakdown of their earnings and deductions, fostering trust and efficiency within the organization.
